```
bundle install --without production
```
This will download any files along with gems in order to make the app run properly.

rails db:migrate
rails server
```
This will launch the server.
* You may need to set up admin credential locally first in order to access admin page.

```
Running via Spring preloader in process 89006
Loading development environment (Rails 5.2.3)

```
Now, you will have to initialize an Admin object by the following line:
```
Admin.create(:password => "whatever_password_you_want", :current_semester => "Spring2019", :statistics_semester => "Spring2019")
```
